I have stored the entire project on a github repo at the following url: https://github.com/NaomiVR/Paradigms-Coursework

The entire application is to be run through the main.py script file in the top-level directory, running the main.py
inside of pycharm will work however as mentioned in the application_message.txt that's shown upon running the app you
may see illegal characters every now and then. To solve this issue I have compiled the application into an executable
under executable/dist/main.exe, this file when run will open it's own command line which supports the 'cls'/'clear'
command-line command (the reason for the illegal characters).


The source code is all available under source/classes/ or on the repo mentioned above.

For the best user experience please use the executable instead of the main.py script.
