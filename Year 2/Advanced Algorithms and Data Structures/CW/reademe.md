Please note that in Task 1 and 2 if you wish to replicate the histogram it will take roughly 2 to 8 minutes depending PC specs.

In order to replicate the historgram for Task 3 it will take much longer, this is due to the nature of the Bellman Ford algorithm compared to Dijkstra's which is used in T1 and 2.

As for functonality of the code please ensure you have installed all requirements as listed in the requirements.txt
